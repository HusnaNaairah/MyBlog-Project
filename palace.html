                    <p>Once again, it was my cousin's birthday, and as always, we aimed for something different, something new. This time around, a lunch birthday party was hosted at the majestic Taj Falaknuma Palace. The mere mention of it had me imagining grandeur and royalty. I initially envisioned a grand ball, but to my amusement, it wasn't anything of the sort. The first surprise was the dress code – semi-formal attire, a requirement for visitors at Falaknuma Palace. The preparations and stress involved in prior booking and securing the time slot were things I only realized later, as I wasn't the host of the event.</p>
                    <p class="p2" >
                    Dressed in our semi-formal best (fortunately, they weren't too strict about it), we arrived at this white building that, at first glance, seemed like any other function hall in the city, as these days, function halls often mimic palaces. However, stepping inside revealed an entirely different world – vast, scenic, and meticulously maintained. The highlight was the breathtaking view from the palace, offering a spectacular panorama of the entire city. Normally, when in Hyderabad, I'd seek out Falaknuma Palace from high points in the city, but this time, the roles were reversed.</p>

                        <p class="p3">The lunch was set at the Adaa restaurant within the palace. To reach it, we traversed through sections adorned with paintings, evoking a regal atmosphere. Passing by a library added to the charm. Adaa itself exuded royalty with chandeliers, antique lamps, and background music that naturally induced a sense of dignified comportment.</p>

                        <p class="p4">The menu card caught my attention, and even the tableware and serviettes fascinated my middle-class mind. The meal progressed slowly, with each item served one after the other. While the cuisine was commendable, I would give it a 4/5 rating, as similar items and flavors can be savored in many Hyderabadi establishments. Falaknuma Palace is more of a sightseeing destination than an exclusive culinary experience, given the comparable offerings in contemporary hotels.Nevertheless, I particularly enjoyed the marag, kebabs, lagan ka gosht, and fish. Even the bhendi (lady's finger) was delicious, maintaining that authentic Nizami and Hyderabadi taste.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>A standout moment during the meal was the raspberry sorbet served in the middle of the course. Initially, I thought it was the dessert and that we had already finished the main course. My surprised expressions were quite evident as I looked around at people sitting in front and around me. However, when they clarified that it was meant to aid digestion and the main course was yet to be served, I felt calm. Dessert, served at the end, was relatively bland, which suited my preference for less sweetness. They presented us with four items – double ka meetha, phirni, an ice cream, and unfortunately, I forgot the fourth. I recall a moment when my uncle questioned why I would hesitate to leave Hyderabad. One of the most obvious reasons is the fantastic Hyderabadi cuisine. Hyderabad is truly a heaven for food lovers.</p>

                        <p class="p5" >Overall, I found the lunch a bit pricey, but the ambience, the view, and the royal feeling made it worth it. We were so engrossed in our meal, conversation, and laughter that we lost track of time and missed the scheduled palace tour. Nevertheless, it didn't bother us much, as some had already explored the palace, and I had my fair share of palace visits, notably the Mysore Palace. Most importantly, my day became truly beautiful when I witnessed a flock of pigeons gracefully circling and flocking around the palace repeatedly in the evening. The sight was not limited to just 10 or 20 pigeons; there were approximately 100 pigeons or even more. I gazed upwards, captivated by the scene that resembled a slow-motion video playing above me. The sun setting behind the finely crafted palace, the pigeons gliding gracefully over and around the structure in perfect synchrony — not too close, not too far from each other. It was truly my moment of the day!</p>

                    <p>Looking back, it truly was a day well spent – with delightful pictures captured, the regal ambience embraced, the essence of Hyderabad cherished, and the captivating view entirely worth the experience. A heartfelt thank you to my cousin for making this grand day possible. Forever grateful.</p>
