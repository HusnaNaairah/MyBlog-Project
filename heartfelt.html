        <h2>A Family's Silent Impact</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <div class="info">

            <p class="matter">One day, my father and I were engaged in a casual conversation in our drawing room. During this conversation, my father shared something that left me deeply amazed and profoundly moved. He mentioned that the minimum cost for a single dialysis session is Rs. 1500, especially in budget-friendly hospitals, and for individuals depending on dialysis due to kidney failure, this procedure is required every alternate day. It's unfortunate that over 2 million people worldwide undergo dialysis treatment.</p>

            
            <p  class="matter">As we looked at it from the hospital’s point of view, considering approximately 20 patients coming in for dialysis every day, we calculated the total expenditure on dialysis treatment alone in such a hospital. The minimum amount, based on Rs. 1,500 per session for 20 patients, came to Rs. 30,000. This is the bare minimum. Taking into account other services and treatments, we conservatively estimated the minimum daily expenditure from a hospital standpoint to be 1 lakh rupees, a monthly expenditure of at least 30 lakhs and an annual cost of 3.6 crores.</p>


            <p  class="matter">This exploration wasn't driven by a desire to understand hospital profits or the appeal of a lucrative medical career. Instead, it was spurred by the existence of "Sitara Medical Centre" in Shah Ali Banda, Hyderabad, a unit of a charitable trust. All the figures mentioned above are specific to this hospital. Sitara Medical Centre allocates a generous 30 lakhs per month (potentially more), offering a range of services from ophthalmology, cardiology, radiology, GI endoscopy, to labs like the pathological lab, all free of charge – from registration and tests to medicines at substantial discounts.</p>

          
            <p  class="matter">Founded by Dr. Ahmed Arif as a tribute to his mother, Sitara, and the values she both advocated and demonstrated throughout her life, this centre is a beacon of generosity. The family that owns and operates it, with both parents and their son being doctors, manages this charitable trust while working in the United States. Hearing this, I was deeply touched by their benevolence, compassion, and high moral principles. What an exceptional family!</p>

         
            <p  class="matter">My father and I exchanged a silent look, pondering whether we would have taken the same path if in their shoes. That day brought clarity to life's fundamental questions for me – "What do you want from life?" and "What is your life's purpose?" This story, I believe, can serve as an inspiration to many. Witnessing such genuine philanthropy was a source of immense inspiration and gratitude for me. It showed me that there's no shortage of kind people around. It was a genuine delight to discover such compassionate souls.</p>

           

            <p  class="matter">I asked my dad to take pictures of the hospital whenever he had the chance, and here's the only photo he captured. Unlike us, who often take multiple shots of the same subject without even changing the angle, only to later struggle in selecting the best one, he came to me with just one picture. I found it cute, and I hold the picture very dear.</p>
