        <h2>The Most Breathtaking Sunset of My Life</h2>
        <article class="info">
            <p>As my engineering days concluded, my family and I, enjoying a collective holiday, embarked on a memorable journey across Karnataka to visit our relatives. Our journey led us through Bangalore and Mysore, with a brief detour to Coorg before reaching Hassan, the final destination before our return to Hyderabad. It was in Hassan that something unforgettable happened.</p>  
            
            <div class="image img1border">
                <img class="img1 img" src="first_place.jpg" alt="Haluvagilu Waterfall">
                <p class="img_name test">Haluvagilu Waterfall</p>
            </div>    

            <p class="p2" >In Hassan, we managed to set aside some time to explore nearby attractions, leading us to the captivating Haluvagilu waterfall, known for its unique walkway positioned amidst the flowing water. When the river runs sufficiently, the walkway vanishes beneath the water's surface, creating the illusion that one is walking or standing directly on the water itself. Eager to capture this spectacle and share it on social media, I was disappointed to find that the summer had left the water level too low for the desired effect.</p>
            
            <p class="p3">Not content with the waterfall experience, my cousin then guided us to Shettyhalli Rosary Church, an abandoned structure that submerges during the monsoon season.You can find out more about its history by clicking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shettihalli_Rosary_Church" target="_blank">here</a>. As we approached, I realized that it wasn't yet monsoon, and our expectations might again go unmet. Evening had fallen, and little did I know that the most beautiful sunset of my life awaited.</p>

            </div>
                    

            <p class="p4">Arriving at our destination, an open space greeted my eyes. I stepped out of the car and turned to witness a mesmerizing sunset, its warm hues reflecting off the car's surface. We explored the area, capturing moments near the remains of the church, not submerged due to the season. Though I missed capturing the sun itself, the church's majestic images lingered in my camera.</p>

            <p class="p5" >The atmosphere took on an eerie quality, resembling scenes from a horror movie, perfect for cinematic brilliance. As time passed, we engaged in activities beyond just clicking pictures. One of the most beautiful moments was skipping stones, something I had never done before. While my brothers effortlessly skipped stones, I initially struggled. Over time, I learned the right technique, choosing flat stones, adjusting my posture, and throwing the stones at the right angle with the required power. Finally, I was able to skip every stone twice on the water. We also played various games, such as determining who could throw things the farthest. To make it fair, we picked pairs of similar items like stones, sticks, or twigs. It turned out to be a lot of fun, and I found myself having the best time there.</p>
            <p class="p6" >As the day deepened into twilight, a beautiful orange sunset cast its reflection on the water. It felt surreal, like the picturesque scenes I had only seen on the internet. It was truly beautiful, with harmonious sounds of the skipping stones, watching the ripples on the orange water, and feeling the cool breeze. Along the banks of the Hemavati reservoir stood an abandoned jeep, seemingly placed with intention, as if awaiting its moment in a photo shoot or film scene. The entire setting was nothing short of an ideal spot for capturing the magic of the moment.</p>

            <p>Lost in the beauty of the moment, I found myself immersed in the scene unfolding before my eyes. The realization struck that to preserve this feeling, I needed to capture it in my camera. I shot videos and captured silhouettes of my family against the picturesque backdrop. The pinkish hue of the twilight sky added to the enchantment. These memories are etched in my heart, and I long for more experiences akin to this enchanting evening. <br>
            Forever grateful for the unexpected magic of that evening!</p>
